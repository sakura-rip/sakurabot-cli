# sakurabot cli

This Cli tool is used for the management of SakuraBot.

SakuraBot is the brand name for LINE BOT.

It's operated by [Sakura](https://github.com/sakura-rip).  
You can't use this Cli tool because it depends on many secret projects.

The purpose of this tool is to automate the management of buyers, servers, etc., which was previously done manually.
